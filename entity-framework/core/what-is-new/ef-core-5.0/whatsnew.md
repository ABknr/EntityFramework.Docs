# What's New in EF Core 5.0

The following list includes the major new features in EF Core 5.0. For the full list of issues in the release, see our [issue tracker](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A5.0.0).

As a major release, EF Core 5.0 also contains several [breaking changes](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-5.0/breaking-changes), which are API improvements that may have negative impact on existing applications.

## Many-to-many

EF Core 5.0 supports many-to-many relationships without explicitly mapping the join table.

For example, consider these entity types:

```csharp
public class Post
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Tag> Tags { get; set; }
}

public class Tag
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Text { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Post> Posts { get; set; }
}
```

EF Core 5.0 recognizes this as a many-to-many relationship by convention, and automatically creates a `PostTag` join table in the database. Data can be queried and updated without explicitly referencing the join table, considerably simplifying code. The join table can still be customized and queried explicitly if needed.

For further information, [see the full documentation on many-to-many](xref:core/modeling/relationships#many-to-many).

## Split queries

Starting with EF Core 3.0, EF Core always generates a single SQL query for each LINQ query. This ensures consistency of the data returned within the constraints of the transaction mode in use. However, this can become very slow when the query uses `Include` or a projection to bring back multiple related collections.

EF Core 5.0 now allows a single LINQ query including related collections to be split into multiple SQL queries. This can significantly improve performance, but can result in inconsistency in the results returned if the data changes between the two queries. Serializable or snapshot transactions can be used to mitigate this and achieve consistency with split queries, but that may bring other performance costs and behavioral difference.

For example, consider a query that pulls in two levels of related collections using `Include`:

```csharp
var artists = context.Artists
    .Include(e => e.Albums)
    .ToList();
```

By default, EF Core will generate the following SQL when using the SQLite provider:

```sql
SELECT a."Id", a."Name", a0."Id", a0."ArtistId", a0."Title"
FROM "Artists" AS a
LEFT JOIN "Album" AS a0 ON a."Id" = a0."ArtistId"
ORDER BY a."Id", a0."Id"
```

With split queries, the following SQL is generated instead:

```sql
SELECT a."Id", a."Name"
FROM "Artists" AS a
ORDER BY a."Id"

SELECT a0."Id", a0."ArtistId", a0."Title", a."Id"
FROM "Artists" AS a
INNER JOIN "Album" AS a0 ON a."Id" = a0."ArtistId"
ORDER BY a."Id"
```

Split queries can be enabled by placing the new `AsSplitQuery` operator anywhere in your LINQ query, or globally in your model's `OnConfiguring`. For further information, [see the full documentation on split queries](xref:core/querying/single-split-queries).

## Simple logging and improved diagnostics

EF Core 5.0 introduces a simple way to set up logging via the new `LogTo` method. The following will cause logging messages to be written to the console, including all SQL generated by EF Core:

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    => optionsBuilder.LogTo(Console.WriteLine);
```

In addition, it is now possible to call `ToQueryString` on any LINQ query, retrieving the SQL that the query would execute:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(
    ctx.Artists
    .Where(a => a.Name == "Pink Floyd")
    .ToQueryString());
```

For further information on simple logging, [see the full documentation](xref:core/logging-events-diagnostics/simple-logging).

## Filtered include

The `Include` method now supports filtering of the entities included:

```csharp
var blogs = context.Blogs
    .Include(e => e.Posts.Where(p => p.Title.Contains("Cheese")))
    .ToList();
```

This query will return blogs together with each associated post, but only when the post title contains "Cheese".

For further information, [see the full documentation on split queries](xref:core/querying/related-data/eager#filtered-include).

## Table-per-type (TPT) mapping

By default, EF Core maps an inheritance hierarchy of .NET types to a single database table. This is known as table-per-hierarchy (TPH) mapping. EF Core 5.0 also allows mapping each .NET type in an inheritance hierarchy to a different database table; known as table-per-type (TPT) mapping.

For example, consider this model with a mapped hierarchy:

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public string EducationLevel { get; set; }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public string FavoriteToy { get; set; }
}
```

With TPT, a database table is created for each type in the hierarchy:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [Animals] (
    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,
    [Name] nvarchar(max) NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Animals] PRIMARY KEY ([Id])
);

CREATE TABLE [Cats] (
    [Id] int NOT NULL,
    [EdcuationLevel] nvarchar(max) NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Cats] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]),
    CONSTRAINT [FK_Cats_Animals_Id] FOREIGN KEY ([Id]) REFERENCES [Animals] ([Id]) ON DELETE NO ACTION,
);

CREATE TABLE [Dogs] (
    [Id] int NOT NULL,
    [FavoriteToy] nvarchar(max) NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Dogs] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]),
    CONSTRAINT [FK_Dogs_Animals_Id] FOREIGN KEY ([Id]) REFERENCES [Animals] ([Id]) ON DELETE NO ACTION,
);
```

For further information, [see the full documentation on TPT](xref:core/modeling/inheritance).

## Flexible entity mapping

Entity types are commonly mapped to tables or views such that EF Core will pull back the contents of the table or view when querying for that type. EF Core 5.0 adds additional mapping options, where an entity can be mapped to a SQL query (called a "defining query"), or to a table-valued function:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Post>().ToSqlQuery(
        @"SELECT Id, Name, Category, BlogId FROM posts
          UNION ALL
          SELECT Id, Name, ""Legacy"", BlogId from legacy_posts");

    modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>().ToFunction("BlogsReturningFunction");
}
```

In addition, it is now possible to map an entity to a view when querying (or to a function or defining query), but to a table when updating:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder
        .Entity<Blog>()
        .ToTable("Blogs")
        .ToView("BlogsView");
}
```

## Shared-type entity types and property bags

EF Core 5.0 allows the same CLR type to be mapped to multiple different entity types; such types are known as shared-type entity types. While any CLR type can be used with this feature, .NET `Dictionary` offers a particularly compelling use-case which we call "property bags":

```csharp
public class ProductsContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Dictionary<string, object>> Products => Set<Dictionary<string, object>>("Product");

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.SharedTypeEntity<Dictionary<string, object>>("Product", b =>
        {
            b.IndexerProperty<int>("Id");
            b.IndexerProperty<string>("Name").IsRequired();
            b.IndexerProperty<decimal>("Price");
        });
    }
}
```

These entities can then be queried and updated just like normal entity types with their own, dedicated CLR type. More information can be found in the documentation on [property bags](xref:core/modeling/shadow-properties).

## Required 1:1 dependents

In EF Core 3.1, the dependent end of a one-to-one relationship was always considered optional. This was most apparent when using owned entities, as all the owned entity's column were created as nullable in the database, even if they were configured as required in the model.

In EF Core 5.0, a navigation to an owned entity can be configured as as a required dependent. For example:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Person>(b =>
    {
        b.OwnsOne(e => e.HomeAddress,
            b =>
            {
                b.Property(e => e.City).IsRequired();
                b.Property(e => e.Postcode).IsRequired();
            });
        b.Navigation(e => e.HomeAddress).IsRequired();
    });
}
```

## DbContextFactory

EF Core 5.0 introduces `AddDbContextFactory` and `AddPooledDbContextFactory` to register a factory for creating DbContext instances in the application's dependency injection (D.I.) container; this can be useful when application code needs to create and dispose context instances manually.

```csharp
services.AddDbContextFactory<SomeDbContext>(b =>
    b.UseSqlServer(@"Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=Test"));
```

At this point, application services such as ASP.NET Core controllers can then be injected with `IDbContextFactory<TContext>`, and use it to instantiate context instances:

```csharp
public class MyController
{
    private readonly IDbContextFactory<SomeDbContext> _contextFactory;

    public MyController(IDbContextFactory<SomeDbContext> contextFactory)
        => _contextFactory = contextFactory;

    public void DoSomeThing()
    {
        using (var context = _contextFactory.CreateDbContext())
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

For further information, [see the full documentation on DbContextFactory](xref:core/dbcontext-configuration/index#using-a-dbcontext-factory-eg-for-blazor).

## SQLite table rebuilds

Compared to other databases, SQLite is relatively limited in its schema manipulation capabilities; for example, dropping a column from an existing table is not supported. EF Core 5.0 works around these limitations by automatically creating a new table, copying the data from the old table, dropping the old table and renaming the new one. This "rebuilds" the table, and allows previously unsupported migration operations to be safely applied.

For details on which migration operations are now supported via table rebuilds, [see this documentation page](xref:core/providers/sqlite/limitations#migrations-limitations).

## Database collations

EF Core 5.0 introduces support for specifying text collations at the database, column or query level. This allows case sensitivity and other textual aspects to be configured in a way that is both flexible and does not compromise query performance.

For example, the following will configure the `Name` column to be case-sensitive on SQL Server, and any indexes created on the column will function accordingly:

```csharp
modelBuilder
    .Entity<User>()
    .Property(e => e.Name)
    .UseCollation("SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS");
```

For further information, [see the full documentation on collations and case sensitivity](xref:core/miscellaneous/collations-and-case-sensitivity).

## Event counters

EF Core 5.0 exposes [event counters](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-diagnostics-improvements-in-net-core-3-0) which can be used to track your application's performance and spot various anomalies. Simply attach to a process running EF with the [dotnet-counters](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters) tool:

```console
> dotnet counters monitor Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -p 49496

```
